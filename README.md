Terraform side project

So far it creates a VPC and a EC2 instance bootstrapped with docker, java, and jenkins. Refer to [aws_ci_cd](https://github.com/yuleetea/aws-ci-cd-jenkins), where I create a ci-cd pipeline for a simple python flask application. This repo is to automate the infrastructure side.

next steps is to add in ASG, ALB, RDS, and S3. Eventually i'm going to add in lambdas.
